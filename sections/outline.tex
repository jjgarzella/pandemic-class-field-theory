Prerequisites
\begin{itemize}
	\item Some familiarity with derived categories/functors,
		some spectral sequences, and group cohomology
	\item No motivation for LCFT will be given, this is assumed.
	%\item Some familiarity with SES-LES arguemnts
	\item Hilbert's theorem 90
	\item "dimension shifting" and "kummer theory" arguments
\end{itemize}


Our first order of business will be to calculate
the brauer group of a local field.
For our purposes, the Brauer group is the 
cohomology group XXXXXXXXXXX.


Once we know the Brauer group, we deduce a few corollaries,
and then we will define the Tate local duality pairing.
We will then prove that this pairing is perfect,
which will allow us to deduce the theorems of
local class field theory.
